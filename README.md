<h1 align="left">UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING<br><i>Topic: Cryptocurrency Trends Forecasting</i> </h1> 

<p>This project aims to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using unsupervised learning techniques.</p>

## Data Science Methods
- Data preprocessing and normalization using StandardScaler
- Finding the best value for K using the elbow method
- Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means with original scaled data
- Feature reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means with PCA data

## Limitations and Further Analysis
- The dataset used in this project is static and may not reflect the current state of the market. Incorporating a dynamic dataset or real-time market data will improve the relevance of the analysis and provide a more accurate representation of the market trends.
- The clustering method used, K-means, may not be the most suitable for all types of data distributions. The project can be extended by using different clustering methods to compare the performance.
- The PCA method reduces the features to a fixed number of principal components, which may lead to a loss of information. Other feature reduction methods can be explored to maintain more information while reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.
